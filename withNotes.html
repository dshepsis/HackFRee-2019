					<h2>I am going to teach you:</h2>
					<p>Vector graphics design in Inkscape</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							I'm here today to give you an introduction to vector graphic design.
							The goal isn't to teach you everything you need to know.
						</p>
						<p>
							My philosophy toward technical learning is that you shouln't fully learn
							a skill you don't already need.
						</p>
						<p>
							Instead, learn at least enough so you
							know what that skill is good for, so if you run into a problem it
							could solve, you can remember it, and relearn it from there.
						</p>

					<h2>Step 1: Vectors graphics</h2>
					<img class="centerpiece" src="img/vector-vs-bitmap.png" alt="Vector (Smooth) vs Bitmap (Blocky)">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							To be very brief, computers normally display things as a grid of
							squares called "pixels", each of which is assigned a color. This is
							called a "bitmap" image, and it's pretty great for a lot of things,
							like pictures, paintings, or video. One big problem, though, is that
							you can't use enlarge or zoom into a bitmap image without losing
							quality, because the bitmap image doesn't contain information about
							what's between the pixels. This causes the blocky, pixelated look
							on the right.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unlike a bitmap, vector images are defined by math and geometry.
							Every shape is defined using a group of lines and curves which
							the computer then uses to calculate what colors are where in the
							image, sort of like a graphic calculator. And just like a graphing
							calculator, you can zoom in infinitely without losing any detail.
							This makes vector graphics great for simple images that you want
							to be sharp at any resolution.
						</p>

					<h2>Step 2: Making Vector Images</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Standard file format: .SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)</li>
						<li>Text-file with XML-based formatting.</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						The most common file format for vector images is Scalable Vector
						Graphics, or .svg for short. It's a human-readable file-format,
						based on XML.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section class="lang-comp-block">
					<h2>SVG Example</h2>

						<img style="width: 250px" src="img/simple-example.svg" alt="An orange circle overlapped by a blue square with a black stroke"/>
						<pre><code class=" hljs SVG" style="font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1.5">&lt;svg width="500" height="500" viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
	&lt;ellipse cx="50" cy="50" rx="40" ry="40"
		style="fill:orange;"
	/&gt;
	&lt;rect x="50" y="25" height="30" width="40"
		style="stroke:black; stroke-width: 10; fill: blue;"
	/&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						Since it's basically just code, you can write SVG files by hand
						if you want. That said, it's usually a lot easier to use a graphical
						editor, such as Inkscape.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="img/inkscape-interface.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						This is what Inkscape looks like. If you're following along on your
						own machine, now is when you should have the software open.
						If you've ever used a photoediting software like Photoshop or GIMP,
						this may look familiar. If not, you
						might be feeling a little intimidated. Why are there so many buttons
						and menus and modes and options? Fortunately I have good news: I know
						what maybe 20% of these things do, and I've gotten by just fine.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Inkscape: Shapes</h2>
					<img class="centerpiece" src="img/inkscape-interface-shapes.png" style="height: 550px"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						These are the 4 simplest, most basic tools in Inkscape. You select
						these form the left menu, or using one of a number of keyboard
						shortcuts that you can discover by hovering your mouse over the
						button.
						<br />
						****** Make sure you open Inkscape for real, right about now ******
						<br />
						The first tool, the cursor, can almost always be accessed
						by pressing Escape 1-3 times. It lets you select objects by clicking.
						Clicking once gives you the stretching handles. Clicking twice gives
						you the rotation and skew handles. You can also click and drag
						anywhere inside the dotted box to drag the object around.
						<br />
						There's a few important things here with the modifier keys: shift,
						control, and alt. When held, each of them has some effect on
						how Inkscape behaves. For example, if you hold CONTROL while dragging
						an object, it will only move horizontally or vertically, which is
						useful for maintaining alignment. If you hold control while
						stretching an object, it will maintain its aspect ratio. If you
						hold control while rotating or skewing an object, it will snap the
						angle to 15 degree increments. If you hold Shift, it will stretch
						the object in both directions. There's a lot more effects I won't
						go over here, but you can look them up, and the dialogue text at
						the bottom of the window will also give you hints at times.
						<br />
						Oh, and another quick note. You can change the what displays in
						front of or behind what by using the page up and down keys, or the
						home and end keys, while you have an object selected.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Inkscape: Paths</h2>
					<img class="centerpiece" src="img/inkscape-interface-pen.png" style="height: 550px"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						These are my favorite tools, and they're the most complicated thing
						I'll be talking about today, so pay attention. Paths are curves
						between 2 or more points (aka nodes). They can overlap and intersect themselves.
						The curves between nodes can be straight lines or curvy lines called
						bezier curves. The easiest way to make a path is with the pen tool.
						You click to start the path, then click for each point you want to
						add. If you click and drag, you'll make the last segment of the path
						curved. When you're done, you can either click on your starting point
						to close the path, or right click anywhere, which leaves the path open.
						<br />
						Once you have a path, you can edit it with the path tool. When you
						click on a path with this tool active, you'll see the nodes shown
						as squares or diamonds. You can click and drag nodes to move them,
						or click and drag the segments to change their curvature. If you
						click on a node next to a curved segment, you'll see circular
						handles appear, which are another way to adjust the curvature of
						adjacent segments.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Inkscape: Fill and Stroke</h2>
					<img class="centerpiece" src="img/inkscape-fill-stroke.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						The fill-and-stroke menu lets you change the color or pattern of the
						inside or outline of a shape or path. If you don't already have it
						open, you can open it by pressing control+shift+f, or by going
						to the object menu at the top. This menu is pretty simple, but
						it's worth noting that even unclosed paths can have a fill. The fill
						area just behaves like the two ends are connected. Another useful
						tool is the stroke-style submenu, which lets you change width of the
						stroke, and make the stroke dashed, or add arrows to either end.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Inkscape: Boolean Operations</h2>
					<img class="centerpiece" src="img/inkscape-boolean-ops.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						The Path menu has a bunch of very useful tools for combining paths
						in various ways. Union combines two paths. Difference takes the
						area of the top path and cuts it out of the bottom path. Intersection
						produces a new path which just contains the area covered by both
						paths. Exclusion is like difference, but the overlapping area is
						removed from both paths. The other options are more niche, and I'll
						leave them for you to research.
						<br />
						This menu also has some other nice tools, like the Object to Path
						button, which lets you turn shapes into paths, so you can edit them
						node-by-node, or use them in boolean operations. One of my favorites
						is Dynamic Offset, near the bottom. This removes all the handles on
						your path and gives you just one, which lets you expand or contract
						the perimeter of the path. I often use this to make gaps between
						parts of a logo, which I'll show you later.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Inkscape: Export PNG</h2>
					<img class="centerpiece" src="img/inkscape-export-png.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						While you can use SVG images in a lot of places, you'll often
						want to convert them into PNG images for one reason or another.
						Inkscape makes this relatively easy. To open the export menu, go to
						the file menu and click "Export PNG Image", or just press
						control+shift+E. Unfortunately there's no tool to just dragging
						over the area you want to export, so you'll usually want to either
						put a rectangle under the image and export selection, or change
						the size of the document and export Page.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Inkscape: Grid</h2>
					<img class="centerpiece" src="img/inkscape-grid.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						The page grid is one of the most useful tools in Inkscape, because
						it lets you make repeatable diagrams with consistent spacing. To
						turn it on, go to the view menu at the top, or press shift+3, which
						gives the hash mark.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Inkscape: Snapping</h2>
					<img class="centerpiece" src="img/inkscape-interface-snapping.png" style="height: 550px"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						To go with the grid, there is the snapping menu. Snapping causes
						objects, paths, nodes, and other things to snap to the grid or
						each other when moved around. This lets you place things precisely,
						without having to move them pixel-by-pixel. The snapping menu is
						usually located on the right side of the window, and each button
						is a toggle. I've labelled them all for you, but the important ones
						are bolded. In general, if you want something to snap but it isn't
						snapping, you probably need to play around with this menu. It's okay
						to not memorize the whole thing, because each button gives a tooltip
						when you hover over it.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Inkscape: Document Properties</h2>
					<img class="centerpiece" src="img/inkscape-doc-properties.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						You can open the Document Properties dialogue by going to the File
						menu at the top, or by pressing control+shift+D. This menu has a lot
						of important and niche options, but the ones I think are essential
						are the size menu, the background-color option, and the Grid menu.
						The size menu lets you set the size and units of the page, including
						pixels, milimeters, and inches. The background color menu is important
						because the default color of the page is actually transparent, which
						means your exported PNGs will come out with no background. Sometimes
						this is what you want, but you often want the background to be white,
						so this is where you would change that. The Grid menu lets you
						change the spacing and color of the grid. It also lets you make
						isometric grids, which are great for 3D technical drawing.

					<h2>Diagrams: Examples</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now we can finally start discussing what I think Inkscape is really
						uesful for: technical diagrams. Let's start with a few examples to
						get your head turning.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="img/diagrams/overall-BFD.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Here's a pretty simple diagram. Just a bunch of boxes, text, and
						arrows. Boxes are all made with simple paths ending in arrows.
						Notice how everything is even and aligned. This type of diagram
						is called a "Block Flow Diagram" or BFD, and it was part of a major
						project I did last semester.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="img/diagrams/methane-to-raw-syngas.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						This one's a bit more complex. Now we have some icons with patterns.
						Everything is still just lines and curves, though, and I'll show you
						how to make this sort of thing in just a minute.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="img/diagrams/miec-diagram.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						This one is actually a replica of a diagram from a scientific paper
						we cited in our report. The original was really small, so when we
						scaled it up, it got unreadably blurry. I just made a quick copy to
						fix that.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Demo: Example Diagram</h2>
					<img class="centerpiece" src="img/diagram-example.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						As a quick demonstration, I'm going to show you how I would go
						about making a diagram like the one shown here. You're free to
						follow along, but I'll be moving pretty quickly, so if you fall
						behind just leave it for later.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Logos: Examples</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						And now it's time for logos. I can't really teach you how to
						come up with good logo designs, but I can show you some examples
						and explain how I created them.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="img/logo/AuLogo.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						This is one of the first logos I made. I'm not too fond of it now,
						but I included it here to show you what you can make with basically
						zero experience.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="img/logo/DS_Redo_optimized.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						This is my current personal logo. You can see all the lines are a
						lot thicker than the last lgoo, which helps you distinguish it at
						small sizes. It's also pure black-on-white. The shapes here are all
						really simple. Most of it is rectangles and circles combined in
						different ways.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="img/logo/AU_Redo_optimized.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Here's the same logo rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. I
						intentionally designed this to read as both AU and DS depending on
						the orientation.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="img/logo/logo_alpha.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						This is one I made for a fan project I'm working on called FightCore.
						The lower prong of the F is supposed to look like a fist, but I
						don't think it turned out that well.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="img/logo/FC_Apple_Mario.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						This is my latest revision of that logo. I redid the fist by tracing
						over an image of an actual fist, and I moved it to the body of the
						F so that it could be made larger and more distinguishable. I also
						added what's supposed to be an apple core to the C, to complete the
						imagery for "Fight" and "Core".
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Demo: Example Logo</h2>
					<img class="centerpiece" src="img/logo/hackfree.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						This is HackFRee's own logo. I don't know how made this, but I think
						they used a lot of the same principles as the logos I made. So as a
						quick demo, I'm going to replicate this diagram in Inkscape, and then
						I'll be taking questions.
